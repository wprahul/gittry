 <div class="postDescription">ach year, people might receive lots of IRS tax notices. Some might receive the letters, and some might receive the emails. Usually, the IRS sends millions of notices and letters to taxpayers for a variety of reasons, so we don&rsquo;t need to be panic when we receive the IRS tax notice. Here is something that we need to know when you receive an IRS tax notice.                                                                             When you receive an IRS tax notice, don&rsquo;t panic, since you often need to respond to take care of a notice.                                                                             IRS might send you a notice for many reasons. For example, IRS might concern about a specific issue on your federal tax return or tax account. A notice might tell you about changes to your account or ask you for more information. But sometimes it could also tell you have unpaid tax or you owe some moneys to the IRS. Different notices have different instructions about what you need to do. And what you need to do is to follow the instructions.                                                                             You may also get a notice that states the IRS has made a change or correction to your tax return. If you do refile your tax return, you then need to review the information and compare it with your original return to make sure that your return is correct and successful. If you agree with the amount of money on that notice, you usually do not need to reply with the correction letter, unless it gives you other instructions or you need to make a payment. If you do not agree with the notice, you have to response this letter. In this situation, you should write a letter to explain why you disagree with this amount, and you have to include any information and documents you want the IRS to consider. Besides, you have to mail your reply with the bottom tear-off portion of the notice, sending it to the address appeared in the upper left-hand corner of the notice. Remember, the IRS usually takes at least 30 days for a response.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Even we have to pay tax to the IRS, we still have several rights. Here are the lists for the bill of Rights for taxpayer according to the IRS:                                                                               The Right to Be Informed                                                                             We taxpayers have the right to know what we need to do comply with the tax laws. We could receive the clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. We also have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about our tax accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes.                                                                               The Right to Quality Service                                                                             When we meet difficulties, we have the right to receive prompt, courteous, and professional assistance in our dealings with the IRS. These instructions need to be in a way that we can easily understand, or we have the right to ask the IRS for further explanations. If we still cannot understand the instructions, the IRS needs to provide a supervisor about the inadequate service.                                                                               The Right to Pay No More than the Correct Amount of Tax                                                                             We must know that we have the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due, including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly. If we find out we pay more than the correct amount, we could file a letter to the IRS and explain our situation.

All the actions from the IRS will respect all due process rights, including search and seizure protection and the IRS will provide a collection due process hearing where applicable.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Many of us might have heard of property tax, which is a kind of tax paid on property owned by an individual or other legal entity. But we might don&rsquo;t know what exactly the property tax is and how the IRS calculate the property tax. This article intends to introduce the property tax in the United States.                                                                             Generally, property tax is a tax that is charged on your property, such as a corporation and a house. The most common type of property tax is a real estate ad-valorem tax, which is a kind of regressive tax (a tax imposed in such a manner that the tax rate decreases as the amount subject to taxation increases). In other words, if you own more real estate, the tax that charges on your will be less. The property is calculated by a local government where the property is located and paid by you, or the owner of the property. The tax is usually based on the value of the owned property, including lands and houses. But lots of jurisdictions also tax tangible personal property as property tax, such as vehicles (cars), boats, and helicopters.                                                                              The property tax will become a source for local infrastructures. For example, the local governing body will use the assessed taxes to fund water and sewer improvements, and provide law enforcement, fire protection, education, road and highway construction, libraries, and other services that benefit the community.                                                                              In the United States, because every state has its own laws and jurisdiction system, the property tax rates and the types of properties taxed also vary by states. Therefore, when we are purchasing a property, it&rsquo;s also essential to scrutinize the applicable tax laws. For instance, if you plan to buy a house in New Jersey while you are working in the city of New York, you might pay the property tax according to the law of Jersey state while you need to pay the income tax according to the regulation of New York City.</div>

TurboTax Free Edition                                                                             Probably TurboTax is the most famous software in terms of tax filing. For people who prefer the free edition of TurboTax, the income limit is $34,000. The software itself is pretty easy to use. It includes unlimited free help from a tax professional. However, if you choose to use TurboTax, you can&rsquo;t import income data or last year&rsquo;s tax info like H&amp;R Block would do.

However, like TurboTax, you can&rsquo;t import data.                                                                             TaxSlayer Simply Free                                                                             The paid version of TaxSlayer is the cheapest one among all tax software, which only needs $17. The free version is also good to use. It has good user interface and it&rsquo;s easy to use if you want to file a simple return. However, the deduction is useless if you only file a 1040 EZ.                                                                             FreeTaxUSA Free Edition                                                                             The FreeTaxUSA Free Edition allows you to file most forms of your taxed.

 <div class="postDescription">With the July 15 tax deadline now past, the Internal Revenue Service reminds all taxpayers that there is no secret way to find out when a refund will be issued.                                                                             Some key facts can help people understand the refund process better:                                                                               Taxpayers who file electronically and use direct deposit can expect their refund faster than those who mail a paper return, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak has reduced IRS staffing available to process paper returns.                                                            Taxpayers who file a paper tax return are likely to face processing and refund delays.                                                            The best and easiest way to check on a refund is Where&rsquo;s My Refund?                                                            The Where&rsquo;s My Refund? tool available on IRS.gov and the IRS2Go mobile app.                                                            A tax refund&rsquo;s status can be checked within 24 hours after the taxpayer receives the e-file acceptance notification.                                                            &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s My Refund?&rdquo; is updated once a day, usually overnight.                                                                             Processing delays for paper tax returns                                                                             The IRS is experiencing delays in processing paper tax returns due to limited staffing. This is causing refund delays. Taxpayers who have already filed a paper return should know that the IRS is processing paper returns in the order in which they are received.In addition, interest on individual 2019 refunds reflected on returns filed by July 15, 2020, will generally be paid from April 15, 2020, until the date of the refund. Interest payments may be received separately from the refund and are considered taxable income in the year received.                                                          Common myths about tax refunds include:                                                                             Getting a refund this year means there&rsquo;s no need to adjust withholding for 2020                                                                             To help avoid a possible surprise next year, taxpayers should look to make changes now. Adjusting tax withholding with an employer can help ensure that neither too much nor too little tax is withheld from an employee&rsquo;s paycheck.                                                                             Calling the IRS or a tax professional will provide a better refund date                                                                             Contacting the IRS or a tax professional will not expedite a refund. IRS assistors and tax professionals cannot move up a refund date nor do they have access to any &ldquo;special&rdquo; information that will provide a more accurate refund date.                                                                             Ordering a tax transcript is a secret way to get a refund date                                                                             Ordering a tax transcript will not help taxpayers find out when they will get their refund and it does not accelerate the issue date of a refund.                                                                             The Where&rsquo;s My Refund? tool is wrong because there&rsquo;s no deposit date yet                                                                             WhenWhere&rsquo;s My Refund?shows the tax return status is received it means that we have received the tax return and are processing it. Some returns may take longer to process than others and needs further review. This includes when a return:                                                                               Includes errors                                                            Is incomplete                                                            Is affected by identity theft or fraud                                                            Includes a Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation, which could take up to 14 weeks to process                                                                             Taxpayers will be contacted by mail if the IRS needs more information to process a tax return. People waiting for a refund in the mail should plan for the additional time a check takes to arrive.                                                                             Something is wrong when the refund amount is less than expected                                                                             There are a lot of reasons that cause a tax refund to be different than expected. Situations that could decrease a refund include:                                                                               Taxpayer math errors or mistakes                                                            Owing federal or state taxes, child support, student loans or other federal non-tax obligations                                                            A portion of the refund is held while IRS reviews an item claimed on the return</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Many of us might encounter mutual funds in our daily life. But what exactly is mutual fund and what kind of function does it have?                                                                             Basically, a mutual fund is a type of financial vehicle made up of a pool of money collected from many investors to invest in securities like stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are operated by professional money managers, who allocate the fund&rsquo;s assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund&rsquo;s investors. Besides, a mutual fund&rsquo;s portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in its prospectus.                                                                             Many mutual funds give small or individual investors access to professionally managed portfolios of equities, bonds, and other securities. As a result, each shareholder participates proportionally in the gains or losses of the fund. Mutual funds invest in a vast number of securities, and its performance is usually tracked as the change in the total market cap of the fund, which is derived by the aggregating performance of the underlying investments.                                                                             That is, a mutual fund is both an investment and an actual company. For example, if you buy Apply stock, you are buying partial ownership of the company and its assets.                                                                             Similarly, when you invest in a mutual fund, you are actually buying partial ownership of the mutual fund company and its assets.                                                                             Investors typically earn a return from a mutual fund in three ways:                                                                                                                           Income is earned from dividends on stocks and interest on bonds held in the fund&rsquo;s portfolio. Funds usually give investors a choice either to receive a check for distributions or to reinvest the earnings and get more shares.                                                                                        When the fund sells securities which could have increased in price, the fund has a capital gain. Most funds also pass on these gains to investors in a distribution.                                                                                        If fund holdings increasing price but are not sold by the fund manager, the shares of this fund will increase in price as well. When you sell your mutual fund shares, you can earn a profit in the market.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Currently, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internet Revenue Service launched an online help portal to help non-filers receive economic impact payments. This online portal is also called &ldquo;IRS Help Online,&rdquo; where Americans who did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019 can submit basic personal information to the IRS so that they can receive payments in an easy way.                                                                             The full name of this online tool is &ldquo;Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here,&rdquo; which is designed for Americans who are not required to file tax returns to make sure they receive their payment as quickly and safely as possible. Inside this online portal, individuals could enter their bank account information, and thus their payment will be directly deposited in their bank account once IRS has proceeded tax return files.                                                                             How to find this online page? Well, you need to go to IRS.gov and click on the &ldquo;Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here&rdquo; button. After that, the tool will request basic information to confirm eligivility, calculate and send the Economic Impact Payments for you.                                                                             Economic Impact Payments might include basic information such as:                                                                                                                             Your full names and Social Security numbers, including for spouse and dependents                                                                                          Your mailing address                                                                                          Your bank account type, account and routing numbers.                                                                                                   Besides &ldquo;Non-Filers&rdquo; tool, the IRS also launches a separate online tool for tax return application, which is called &ldquo;Get My Payment.&rdquo; This tool allows taxpayers who filed their tax return in 2018 or 2019 but did not provide their bank information on their return to submit direct information so that they can receive payments immediately. &ldquo;Get My Payment&rdquo; will also allow taxpayers to track the status of their payment.                                                                             However, for Social Security recipients, if you did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019, you do not need to use these tools or take any actions. IRS will use the information on the Form SSA-1099 and Form RRB-1099 to generate $1,200 Economic Impact Payments.</div>

This article intends to the introduce this term as well as its functions in our daily life.                                                                             Social Security benefits are payments made to qualified retirees and disabled people, and to their spouses, children, and survivors. The official name for Social Security is &ldquo;the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program in the United States.&rdquo; It refers to a comprehensive federal benefits program designed to provide partial replacement income for older workers and their spouse, those whose spouse or qualifying ex-spouse have died, and the disabled. In some specific circumstances, it also supports children and beneficiaries.                                                                             The history of Social Security benefits could be traced back to 1935, when President Franklin Roosevelt signed the original Social Security Act into law. After a number of amendments, the current law includes several social insurance and social welfare programs, such as the issuance of Social Security benefits. All of these benefits are determined by a specific set of criteria issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA).                                                                             Social Security benefits work with the payroll taxes. Payroll taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax or the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA) (a tax designed for self-employed individuals) fund Social Security and all of its benefits. The Internal Revenue Service collects tax deposits and formally entrusts them to the Social Security Trust Fund, which is made up of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund. In other words, Social Security benefits are funded by the taxes.                                                                             Individuals qualify for Social Security old age (or retirement) benefits by paying into the program during their working years.                                                                             For example, full insurance is based on accumulating 40 credits from covered wages, and a worker can earn up to four credits a year. Starting in 2020, one credit is awarded for every $1,410 in earnings. Besides, this amount is adjusted annually to keep up with inflation, which means one credit might be worth more in the future years during an inflation.</div>

The Social Security disability waiting period begins with the first full month after the date that IRS decides your disability began.

 <div class="postDescription">ach year, people might receive lots of IRS tax notices. Some might receive the letters, and some might receive the emails. Usually, the IRS sends millions of notices and letters to taxpayers for a variety of reasons, so we don&rsquo;t need to be panic when we receive the IRS tax notice. Here is something that we need to know when you receive an IRS tax notice.                                                                             When you receive an IRS tax notice, don&rsquo;t panic, since you often need to respond to take care of a notice.                                                                             IRS might send you a notice for many reasons. For example, IRS might concern about a specific issue on your federal tax return or tax account. A notice might tell you about changes to your account or ask you for more information. But sometimes it could also tell you have unpaid tax or you owe some moneys to the IRS. Different notices have different instructions about what you need to do. And what you need to do is to follow the instructions.                                                                             You may also get a notice that states the IRS has made a change or correction to your tax return. If you do refile your tax return, you then need to review the information and compare it with your original return to make sure that your return is correct and successful. If you agree with the amount of money on that notice, you usually do not need to reply with the correction letter, unless it gives you other instructions or you need to make a payment. If you do not agree with the notice, you have to response this letter. In this situation, you should write a letter to explain why you disagree with this amount, and you have to include any information and documents you want the IRS to consider. Besides, you have to mail your reply with the bottom tear-off portion of the notice, sending it to the address appeared in the upper left-hand corner of the notice. Remember, the IRS usually takes at least 30 days for a response.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Even we have to pay tax to the IRS, we still have several rights. Here are the lists for the bill of Rights for taxpayer according to the IRS:                                                                               The Right to Be Informed                                                                             We taxpayers have the right to know what we need to do comply with the tax laws. We could receive the clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. We also have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about our tax accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes.                                                                               The Right to Quality Service                                                                             When we meet difficulties, we have the right to receive prompt, courteous, and professional assistance in our dealings with the IRS. These instructions need to be in a way that we can easily understand, or we have the right to ask the IRS for further explanations. If we still cannot understand the instructions, the IRS needs to provide a supervisor about the inadequate service.                                                                               The Right to Pay No More than the Correct Amount of Tax                                                                             We must know that we have the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due, including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly. If we find out we pay more than the correct amount, we could file a letter to the IRS and explain our situation.

All the actions from the IRS will respect all due process rights, including search and seizure protection and the IRS will provide a collection due process hearing where applicable.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Many of us might have heard of property tax, which is a kind of tax paid on property owned by an individual or other legal entity. But we might don&rsquo;t know what exactly the property tax is and how the IRS calculate the property tax. This article intends to introduce the property tax in the United States.                                                                             Generally, property tax is a tax that is charged on your property, such as a corporation and a house. The most common type of property tax is a real estate ad-valorem tax, which is a kind of regressive tax (a tax imposed in such a manner that the tax rate decreases as the amount subject to taxation increases). In other words, if you own more real estate, the tax that charges on your will be less. The property is calculated by a local government where the property is located and paid by you, or the owner of the property. The tax is usually based on the value of the owned property, including lands and houses. But lots of jurisdictions also tax tangible personal property as property tax, such as vehicles (cars), boats, and helicopters.                                                                              The property tax will become a source for local infrastructures. For example, the local governing body will use the assessed taxes to fund water and sewer improvements, and provide law enforcement, fire protection, education, road and highway construction, libraries, and other services that benefit the community.                                                                              In the United States, because every state has its own laws and jurisdiction system, the property tax rates and the types of properties taxed also vary by states. Therefore, when we are purchasing a property, it&rsquo;s also essential to scrutinize the applicable tax laws. For instance, if you plan to buy a house in New Jersey while you are working in the city of New York, you might pay the property tax according to the law of Jersey state while you need to pay the income tax according to the regulation of New York City.</div>

However, if you choose to use TurboTax, you can&rsquo;t import income data or last year&rsquo;s tax info like H&amp;R Block would do.                                                                             TaxAct Free Edition                                                                             TaxAct Free Edition offers simple tax return and free filing for school tax deduction, W-2 processing and more. If you are self-employed, you can also use this software. There is an online answer center for questions and help with using TaxAct. However, like TurboTax, you can&rsquo;t import data.                                                                             TaxSlayer Simply Free                                                                             The paid version of TaxSlayer is the cheapest one among all tax software, which only needs $17. The free version is also good to use. It has good user interface and it&rsquo;s easy to use if you want to file a simple return. However, the deduction is useless if you only file a 1040 EZ.                                                                             FreeTaxUSA Free Edition                                                                             The FreeTaxUSA Free Edition allows you to file most forms of your taxed. You can import your data not only from last year, but also years prior to the next year, which makes things easier and help you file quickly.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">With the July 15 tax deadline now past, the Internal Revenue Service reminds all taxpayers that there is no secret way to find out when a refund will be issued.                                                                             Some key facts can help people understand the refund process better:                                                                               Taxpayers who file electronically and use direct deposit can expect their refund faster than those who mail a paper return, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak has reduced IRS staffing available to process paper returns.                                                            Taxpayers who file a paper tax return are likely to face processing and refund delays.                                                            The best and easiest way to check on a refund is Where&rsquo;s My Refund?                                                            The Where&rsquo;s My Refund? tool available on IRS.gov and the IRS2Go mobile app.                                                            A tax refund&rsquo;s status can be checked within 24 hours after the taxpayer receives the e-file acceptance notification.                                                            &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s My Refund?&rdquo; is updated once a day, usually overnight.                                                                             Processing delays for paper tax returns                                                                             The IRS is experiencing delays in processing paper tax returns due to limited staffing. This is causing refund delays. Taxpayers who have already filed a paper return should know that the IRS is processing paper returns in the order in which they are received.In addition, interest on individual 2019 refunds reflected on returns filed by July 15, 2020, will generally be paid from April 15, 2020, until the date of the refund. Interest payments may be received separately from the refund and are considered taxable income in the year received.                                                          Common myths about tax refunds include:                                                                             Getting a refund this year means there&rsquo;s no need to adjust withholding for 2020                                                                             To help avoid a possible surprise next year, taxpayers should look to make changes now. Adjusting tax withholding with an employer can help ensure that neither too much nor too little tax is withheld from an employee&rsquo;s paycheck.                                                                             Calling the IRS or a tax professional will provide a better refund date                                                                             Contacting the IRS or a tax professional will not expedite a refund. IRS assistors and tax professionals cannot move up a refund date nor do they have access to any &ldquo;special&rdquo; information that will provide a more accurate refund date.                                                                             Ordering a tax transcript is a secret way to get a refund date                                                                             Ordering a tax transcript will not help taxpayers find out when they will get their refund and it does not accelerate the issue date of a refund.                                                                             The Where&rsquo;s My Refund? tool is wrong because there&rsquo;s no deposit date yet                                                                             WhenWhere&rsquo;s My Refund?shows the tax return status is received it means that we have received the tax return and are processing it. Some returns may take longer to process than others and needs further review. This includes when a return:                                                                               Includes errors                                                            Is incomplete                                                            Is affected by identity theft or fraud                                                            Includes a Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation, which could take up to 14 weeks to process                                                                             Taxpayers will be contacted by mail if the IRS needs more information to process a tax return. People waiting for a refund in the mail should plan for the additional time a check takes to arrive.                                                                             Something is wrong when the refund amount is less than expected                                                                             There are a lot of reasons that cause a tax refund to be different than expected. Situations that could decrease a refund include:                                                                               Taxpayer math errors or mistakes                                                            Owing federal or state taxes, child support, student loans or other federal non-tax obligations                                                            A portion of the refund is held while IRS reviews an item claimed on the return</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Many of us might encounter mutual funds in our daily life. But what exactly is mutual fund and what kind of function does it have?                                                                             Basically, a mutual fund is a type of financial vehicle made up of a pool of money collected from many investors to invest in securities like stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are operated by professional money managers, who allocate the fund&rsquo;s assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund&rsquo;s investors. Besides, a mutual fund&rsquo;s portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in its prospectus.                                                                             Many mutual funds give small or individual investors access to professionally managed portfolios of equities, bonds, and other securities. As a result, each shareholder participates proportionally in the gains or losses of the fund. Mutual funds invest in a vast number of securities, and its performance is usually tracked as the change in the total market cap of the fund, which is derived by the aggregating performance of the underlying investments.                                                                             That is, a mutual fund is both an investment and an actual company. For example, if you buy Apply stock, you are buying partial ownership of the company and its assets.                                                                             Similarly, when you invest in a mutual fund, you are actually buying partial ownership of the mutual fund company and its assets.                                                                             Investors typically earn a return from a mutual fund in three ways:                                                                                                                           Income is earned from dividends on stocks and interest on bonds held in the fund&rsquo;s portfolio. Funds usually give investors a choice either to receive a check for distributions or to reinvest the earnings and get more shares.                                                                                        When the fund sells securities which could have increased in price, the fund has a capital gain. Most funds also pass on these gains to investors in a distribution.                                                                                        If fund holdings increasing price but are not sold by the fund manager, the shares of this fund will increase in price as well. When you sell your mutual fund shares, you can earn a profit in the market.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Currently, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internet Revenue Service launched an online help portal to help non-filers receive economic impact payments. This online portal is also called &ldquo;IRS Help Online,&rdquo; where Americans who did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019 can submit basic personal information to the IRS so that they can receive payments in an easy way.                                                                             The full name of this online tool is &ldquo;Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here,&rdquo; which is designed for Americans who are not required to file tax returns to make sure they receive their payment as quickly and safely as possible. Inside this online portal, individuals could enter their bank account information, and thus their payment will be directly deposited in their bank account once IRS has proceeded tax return files.                                                                             How to find this online page? Well, you need to go to IRS.gov and click on the &ldquo;Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here&rdquo; button. After that, the tool will request basic information to confirm eligivility, calculate and send the Economic Impact Payments for you.                                                                             Economic Impact Payments might include basic information such as:                                                                                                                             Your full names and Social Security numbers, including for spouse and dependents                                                                                          Your mailing address                                                                                          Your bank account type, account and routing numbers.                                                                                                   Besides &ldquo;Non-Filers&rdquo; tool, the IRS also launches a separate online tool for tax return application, which is called &ldquo;Get My Payment.&rdquo; This tool allows taxpayers who filed their tax return in 2018 or 2019 but did not provide their bank information on their return to submit direct information so that they can receive payments immediately. &ldquo;Get My Payment&rdquo; will also allow taxpayers to track the status of their payment.                                                                             However, for Social Security recipients, if you did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019, you do not need to use these tools or take any actions. IRS will use the information on the Form SSA-1099 and Form RRB-1099 to generate $1,200 Economic Impact Payments.</div>

The official name for Social Security is &ldquo;the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program in the United States.&rdquo; It refers to a comprehensive federal benefits program designed to provide partial replacement income for older workers and their spouse, those whose spouse or qualifying ex-spouse have died, and the disabled. In some specific circumstances, it also supports children and beneficiaries.                                                                             The history of Social Security benefits could be traced back to 1935, when President Franklin Roosevelt signed the original Social Security Act into law. After a number of amendments, the current law includes several social insurance and social welfare programs, such as the issuance of Social Security benefits. All of these benefits are determined by a specific set of criteria issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA).                                                                             Social Security benefits work with the payroll taxes. Payroll taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax or the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA) (a tax designed for self-employed individuals) fund Social Security and all of its benefits. The Internal Revenue Service collects tax deposits and formally entrusts them to the Social Security Trust Fund, which is made up of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund. In other words, Social Security benefits are funded by the taxes.                                                                             Individuals qualify for Social Security old age (or retirement) benefits by paying into the program during their working years.                                                                             For example, full insurance is based on accumulating 40 credits from covered wages, and a worker can earn up to four credits a year. Starting in 2020, one credit is awarded for every $1,410 in earnings. Besides, this amount is adjusted annually to keep up with inflation, which means one credit might be worth more in the future years during an inflation.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Although many of us have certain understandings towards Disability benefits, we might wonder when and how to apply for Social Security benefits. This article intends to introduce the common procedures for this application.                                                                             If you become disabled, you should apply for Social Security benefits as soon as possible. You can apply for both Social Security and Supplemental Security Income:                                                                                                                             Social Security                                                                                                   This is a disability benefits, and it will not begin until the sixth full month of disability. The Social Security disability waiting period begins with the first full month after the date that IRS decides your disability began.                                                                                                                             Supplemental Security Income (SSI)                                                                                                   The IRS usually pays SSI disability benefits for the first full month after the date you filed your claim. If you file your document in a later date, the IRS will put the first month at the date you become eligible for SSI.

 <div class="postDescription">ach year, people might receive lots of IRS tax notices. Some might receive the letters, and some might receive the emails. Usually, the IRS sends millions of notices and letters to taxpayers for a variety of reasons, so we don&rsquo;t need to be panic when we receive the IRS tax notice. Here is something that we need to know when you receive an IRS tax notice.                                                                             When you receive an IRS tax notice, don&rsquo;t panic, since you often need to respond to take care of a notice.                                                                             IRS might send you a notice for many reasons. For example, IRS might concern about a specific issue on your federal tax return or tax account. A notice might tell you about changes to your account or ask you for more information. But sometimes it could also tell you have unpaid tax or you owe some moneys to the IRS. Different notices have different instructions about what you need to do. And what you need to do is to follow the instructions.                                                                             You may also get a notice that states the IRS has made a change or correction to your tax return. If you do refile your tax return, you then need to review the information and compare it with your original return to make sure that your return is correct and successful. If you agree with the amount of money on that notice, you usually do not need to reply with the correction letter, unless it gives you other instructions or you need to make a payment. If you do not agree with the notice, you have to response this letter. In this situation, you should write a letter to explain why you disagree with this amount, and you have to include any information and documents you want the IRS to consider. Besides, you have to mail your reply with the bottom tear-off portion of the notice, sending it to the address appeared in the upper left-hand corner of the notice. Remember, the IRS usually takes at least 30 days for a response.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Even we have to pay tax to the IRS, we still have several rights. Here are the lists for the bill of Rights for taxpayer according to the IRS:                                                                               The Right to Be Informed                                                                             We taxpayers have the right to know what we need to do comply with the tax laws. We could receive the clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. We also have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about our tax accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes.                                                                               The Right to Quality Service                                                                             When we meet difficulties, we have the right to receive prompt, courteous, and professional assistance in our dealings with the IRS. These instructions need to be in a way that we can easily understand, or we have the right to ask the IRS for further explanations. If we still cannot understand the instructions, the IRS needs to provide a supervisor about the inadequate service.                                                                               The Right to Pay No More than the Correct Amount of Tax                                                                             We must know that we have the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due, including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly. If we find out we pay more than the correct amount, we could file a letter to the IRS and explain our situation.                                                                               The Right to Privacy                                                                             Although the IRS knows lots of our personal information including SSN and our correct address, we still have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply with law and be no more intrusive than necessary. All the actions from the IRS will respect all due process rights, including search and seizure protection and the IRS will provide a collection due process hearing where applicable.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Many of us might have heard of property tax, which is a kind of tax paid on property owned by an individual or other legal entity. But we might don&rsquo;t know what exactly the property tax is and how the IRS calculate the property tax. This article intends to introduce the property tax in the United States.                                                                             Generally, property tax is a tax that is charged on your property, such as a corporation and a house. The most common type of property tax is a real estate ad-valorem tax, which is a kind of regressive tax (a tax imposed in such a manner that the tax rate decreases as the amount subject to taxation increases). In other words, if you own more real estate, the tax that charges on your will be less. The property is calculated by a local government where the property is located and paid by you, or the owner of the property. The tax is usually based on the value of the owned property, including lands and houses. But lots of jurisdictions also tax tangible personal property as property tax, such as vehicles (cars), boats, and helicopters.                                                                              The property tax will become a source for local infrastructures. For example, the local governing body will use the assessed taxes to fund water and sewer improvements, and provide law enforcement, fire protection, education, road and highway construction, libraries, and other services that benefit the community.                                                                              In the United States, because every state has its own laws and jurisdiction system, the property tax rates and the types of properties taxed also vary by states. Therefore, when we are purchasing a property, it&rsquo;s also essential to scrutinize the applicable tax laws. For instance, if you plan to buy a house in New Jersey while you are working in the city of New York, you might pay the property tax according to the law of Jersey state while you need to pay the income tax according to the regulation of New York City.</div>

However, if you choose to use TurboTax, you can&rsquo;t import income data or last year&rsquo;s tax info like H&amp;R Block would do.                                                                             TaxAct Free Edition                                                                             TaxAct Free Edition offers simple tax return and free filing for school tax deduction, W-2 processing and more. If you are self-employed, you can also use this software. There is an online answer center for questions and help with using TaxAct. However, like TurboTax, you can&rsquo;t import data.                                                                             TaxSlayer Simply Free                                                                             The paid version of TaxSlayer is the cheapest one among all tax software, which only needs $17. The free version is also good to use. It has good user interface and it&rsquo;s easy to use if you want to file a simple return. However, the deduction is useless if you only file a 1040 EZ.                                                                             FreeTaxUSA Free Edition                                                                             The FreeTaxUSA Free Edition allows you to file most forms of your taxed. You can import your data not only from last year, but also years prior to the next year, which makes things easier and help you file quickly.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">With the July 15 tax deadline now past, the Internal Revenue Service reminds all taxpayers that there is no secret way to find out when a refund will be issued.                                                                             Some key facts can help people understand the refund process better:                                                                               Taxpayers who file electronically and use direct deposit can expect their refund faster than those who mail a paper return, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak has reduced IRS staffing available to process paper returns.                                                            Taxpayers who file a paper tax return are likely to face processing and refund delays.                                                            The best and easiest way to check on a refund is Where&rsquo;s My Refund?                                                            The Where&rsquo;s My Refund? tool available on IRS.gov and the IRS2Go mobile app.                                                            A tax refund&rsquo;s status can be checked within 24 hours after the taxpayer receives the e-file acceptance notification.                                                            &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s My Refund?&rdquo; is updated once a day, usually overnight.                                                                             Processing delays for paper tax returns                                                                             The IRS is experiencing delays in processing paper tax returns due to limited staffing. This is causing refund delays. Taxpayers who have already filed a paper return should know that the IRS is processing paper returns in the order in which they are received.In addition, interest on individual 2019 refunds reflected on returns filed by July 15, 2020, will generally be paid from April 15, 2020, until the date of the refund. Interest payments may be received separately from the refund and are considered taxable income in the year received.                                                          Common myths about tax refunds include:                                                                             Getting a refund this year means there&rsquo;s no need to adjust withholding for 2020                                                                             To help avoid a possible surprise next year, taxpayers should look to make changes now. Adjusting tax withholding with an employer can help ensure that neither too much nor too little tax is withheld from an employee&rsquo;s paycheck.                                                                             Calling the IRS or a tax professional will provide a better refund date                                                                             Contacting the IRS or a tax professional will not expedite a refund. IRS assistors and tax professionals cannot move up a refund date nor do they have access to any &ldquo;special&rdquo; information that will provide a more accurate refund date.                                                                             Ordering a tax transcript is a secret way to get a refund date                                                                             Ordering a tax transcript will not help taxpayers find out when they will get their refund and it does not accelerate the issue date of a refund.                                                                             The Where&rsquo;s My Refund? tool is wrong because there&rsquo;s no deposit date yet                                                                             WhenWhere&rsquo;s My Refund?shows the tax return status is received it means that we have received the tax return and are processing it. Some returns may take longer to process than others and needs further review. This includes when a return:                                                                               Includes errors                                                            Is incomplete                                                            Is affected by identity theft or fraud                                                            Includes a Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation, which could take up to 14 weeks to process                                                                             Taxpayers will be contacted by mail if the IRS needs more information to process a tax return. People waiting for a refund in the mail should plan for the additional time a check takes to arrive.                                                                             Something is wrong when the refund amount is less than expected                                                                             There are a lot of reasons that cause a tax refund to be different than expected. Situations that could decrease a refund include:                                                                               Taxpayer math errors or mistakes                                                            Owing federal or state taxes, child support, student loans or other federal non-tax obligations                                                            A portion of the refund is held while IRS reviews an item claimed on the return</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Many of us might encounter mutual funds in our daily life. But what exactly is mutual fund and what kind of function does it have?                                                                             Basically, a mutual fund is a type of financial vehicle made up of a pool of money collected from many investors to invest in securities like stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are operated by professional money managers, who allocate the fund&rsquo;s assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund&rsquo;s investors. Besides, a mutual fund&rsquo;s portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in its prospectus.                                                                             Many mutual funds give small or individual investors access to professionally managed portfolios of equities, bonds, and other securities. As a result, each shareholder participates proportionally in the gains or losses of the fund. Mutual funds invest in a vast number of securities, and its performance is usually tracked as the change in the total market cap of the fund, which is derived by the aggregating performance of the underlying investments.                                                                             That is, a mutual fund is both an investment and an actual company. For example, if you buy Apply stock, you are buying partial ownership of the company and its assets.                                                                             Similarly, when you invest in a mutual fund, you are actually buying partial ownership of the mutual fund company and its assets.                                                                             Investors typically earn a return from a mutual fund in three ways:                                                                                                                           Income is earned from dividends on stocks and interest on bonds held in the fund&rsquo;s portfolio. Funds usually give investors a choice either to receive a check for distributions or to reinvest the earnings and get more shares.                                                                                        When the fund sells securities which could have increased in price, the fund has a capital gain. Most funds also pass on these gains to investors in a distribution.                                                                                        If fund holdings increasing price but are not sold by the fund manager, the shares of this fund will increase in price as well. When you sell your mutual fund shares, you can earn a profit in the market.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Currently, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internet Revenue Service launched an online help portal to help non-filers receive economic impact payments. This online portal is also called &ldquo;IRS Help Online,&rdquo; where Americans who did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019 can submit basic personal information to the IRS so that they can receive payments in an easy way.                                                                             The full name of this online tool is &ldquo;Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here,&rdquo; which is designed for Americans who are not required to file tax returns to make sure they receive their payment as quickly and safely as possible. Inside this online portal, individuals could enter their bank account information, and thus their payment will be directly deposited in their bank account once IRS has proceeded tax return files.                                                                             How to find this online page? Well, you need to go to IRS.gov and click on the &ldquo;Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here&rdquo; button. After that, the tool will request basic information to confirm eligivility, calculate and send the Economic Impact Payments for you.                                                                             Economic Impact Payments might include basic information such as:                                                                                                                             Your full names and Social Security numbers, including for spouse and dependents                                                                                          Your mailing address                                                                                          Your bank account type, account and routing numbers.                                                                                                   Besides &ldquo;Non-Filers&rdquo; tool, the IRS also launches a separate online tool for tax return application, which is called &ldquo;Get My Payment.&rdquo; This tool allows taxpayers who filed their tax return in 2018 or 2019 but did not provide their bank information on their return to submit direct information so that they can receive payments immediately. &ldquo;Get My Payment&rdquo; will also allow taxpayers to track the status of their payment.                                                                             However, for Social Security recipients, if you did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019, you do not need to use these tools or take any actions. IRS will use the information on the Form SSA-1099 and Form RRB-1099 to generate $1,200 Economic Impact Payments.</div>

The official name for Social Security is &ldquo;the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program in the United States.&rdquo; It refers to a comprehensive federal benefits program designed to provide partial replacement income for older workers and their spouse, those whose spouse or qualifying ex-spouse have died, and the disabled. In some specific circumstances, it also supports children and beneficiaries.                                                                             The history of Social Security benefits could be traced back to 1935, when President Franklin Roosevelt signed the original Social Security Act into law. After a number of amendments, the current law includes several social insurance and social welfare programs, such as the issuance of Social Security benefits. All of these benefits are determined by a specific set of criteria issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA).                                                                             Social Security benefits work with the payroll taxes. Payroll taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax or the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA) (a tax designed for self-employed individuals) fund Social Security and all of its benefits. The Internal Revenue Service collects tax deposits and formally entrusts them to the Social Security Trust Fund, which is made up of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund. In other words, Social Security benefits are funded by the taxes.                                                                             Individuals qualify for Social Security old age (or retirement) benefits by paying into the program during their working years.                                                                             For example, full insurance is based on accumulating 40 credits from covered wages, and a worker can earn up to four credits a year. Starting in 2020, one credit is awarded for every $1,410 in earnings. Besides, this amount is adjusted annually to keep up with inflation, which means one credit might be worth more in the future years during an inflation.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Although many of us have certain understandings towards Disability benefits, we might wonder when and how to apply for Social Security benefits. This article intends to introduce the common procedures for this application.                                                                             If you become disabled, you should apply for Social Security benefits as soon as possible. You can apply for both Social Security and Supplemental Security Income:                                                                                                                             Social Security                                                                                                   This is a disability benefits, and it will not begin until the sixth full month of disability. The Social Security disability waiting period begins with the first full month after the date that IRS decides your disability began.                                                                                                                             Supplemental Security Income (SSI)                                                                                                   The IRS usually pays SSI disability benefits for the first full month after the date you filed your claim. If you file your document in a later date, the IRS will put the first month at the date you become eligible for SSI.

 <div class="postDescription">ach year, people might receive lots of IRS tax notices. Some might receive the letters, and some might receive the emails. Usually, the IRS sends millions of notices and letters to taxpayers for a variety of reasons, so we don&rsquo;t need to be panic when we receive the IRS tax notice. Here is something that we need to know when you receive an IRS tax notice.                                                                             When you receive an IRS tax notice, don&rsquo;t panic, since you often need to respond to take care of a notice.                                                                             IRS might send you a notice for many reasons. For example, IRS might concern about a specific issue on your federal tax return or tax account. A notice might tell you about changes to your account or ask you for more information. But sometimes it could also tell you have unpaid tax or you owe some moneys to the IRS. Different notices have different instructions about what you need to do. And what you need to do is to follow the instructions.                                                                             You may also get a notice that states the IRS has made a change or correction to your tax return. If you do refile your tax return, you then need to review the information and compare it with your original return to make sure that your return is correct and successful. If you agree with the amount of money on that notice, you usually do not need to reply with the correction letter, unless it gives you other instructions or you need to make a payment. If you do not agree with the notice, you have to response this letter. In this situation, you should write a letter to explain why you disagree with this amount, and you have to include any information and documents you want the IRS to consider. Besides, you have to mail your reply with the bottom tear-off portion of the notice, sending it to the address appeared in the upper left-hand corner of the notice. Remember, the IRS usually takes at least 30 days for a response.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Even we have to pay tax to the IRS, we still have several rights. Here are the lists for the bill of Rights for taxpayer according to the IRS:                                                                               The Right to Be Informed                                                                             We taxpayers have the right to know what we need to do comply with the tax laws. We could receive the clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. We also have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about our tax accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes.                                                                               The Right to Quality Service                                                                             When we meet difficulties, we have the right to receive prompt, courteous, and professional assistance in our dealings with the IRS. These instructions need to be in a way that we can easily understand, or we have the right to ask the IRS for further explanations. If we still cannot understand the instructions, the IRS needs to provide a supervisor about the inadequate service.                                                                               The Right to Pay No More than the Correct Amount of Tax                                                                             We must know that we have the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due, including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly. If we find out we pay more than the correct amount, we could file a letter to the IRS and explain our situation.                                                                               The Right to Privacy                                                                             Although the IRS knows lots of our personal information including SSN and our correct address, we still have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply with law and be no more intrusive than necessary. All the actions from the IRS will respect all due process rights, including search and seizure protection and the IRS will provide a collection due process hearing where applicable.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Many of us might have heard of property tax, which is a kind of tax paid on property owned by an individual or other legal entity. But we might don&rsquo;t know what exactly the property tax is and how the IRS calculate the property tax. This article intends to introduce the property tax in the United States.                                                                             Generally, property tax is a tax that is charged on your property, such as a corporation and a house. The most common type of property tax is a real estate ad-valorem tax, which is a kind of regressive tax (a tax imposed in such a manner that the tax rate decreases as the amount subject to taxation increases). In other words, if you own more real estate, the tax that charges on your will be less. The property is calculated by a local government where the property is located and paid by you, or the owner of the property. The tax is usually based on the value of the owned property, including lands and houses. But lots of jurisdictions also tax tangible personal property as property tax, such as vehicles (cars), boats, and helicopters.                                                                              The property tax will become a source for local infrastructures. For example, the local governing body will use the assessed taxes to fund water and sewer improvements, and provide law enforcement, fire protection, education, road and highway construction, libraries, and other services that benefit the community.                                                                              In the United States, because every state has its own laws and jurisdiction system, the property tax rates and the types of properties taxed also vary by states. Therefore, when we are purchasing a property, it&rsquo;s also essential to scrutinize the applicable tax laws. For instance, if you plan to buy a house in New Jersey while you are working in the city of New York, you might pay the property tax according to the law of Jersey state while you need to pay the income tax according to the regulation of New York City.</div>

However, if you choose to use TurboTax, you can&rsquo;t import income data or last year&rsquo;s tax info like H&amp;R Block would do.                                                                             TaxAct Free Edition                                                                             TaxAct Free Edition offers simple tax return and free filing for school tax deduction, W-2 processing and more. If you are self-employed, you can also use this software. There is an online answer center for questions and help with using TaxAct. However, like TurboTax, you can&rsquo;t import data.                                                                             TaxSlayer Simply Free                                                                             The paid version of TaxSlayer is the cheapest one among all tax software, which only needs $17. The free version is also good to use. It has good user interface and it&rsquo;s easy to use if you want to file a simple return. However, the deduction is useless if you only file a 1040 EZ.                                                                             FreeTaxUSA Free Edition                                                                             The FreeTaxUSA Free Edition allows you to file most forms of your taxed. You can import your data not only from last year, but also years prior to the next year, which makes things easier and help you file quickly.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">With the July 15 tax deadline now past, the Internal Revenue Service reminds all taxpayers that there is no secret way to find out when a refund will be issued.                                                                             Some key facts can help people understand the refund process better:                                                                               Taxpayers who file electronically and use direct deposit can expect their refund faster than those who mail a paper return, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak has reduced IRS staffing available to process paper returns.                                                            Taxpayers who file a paper tax return are likely to face processing and refund delays.                                                            The best and easiest way to check on a refund is Where&rsquo;s My Refund?                                                            The Where&rsquo;s My Refund? tool available on IRS.gov and the IRS2Go mobile app.                                                            A tax refund&rsquo;s status can be checked within 24 hours after the taxpayer receives the e-file acceptance notification.                                                            &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s My Refund?&rdquo; is updated once a day, usually overnight.                                                                             Processing delays for paper tax returns                                                                             The IRS is experiencing delays in processing paper tax returns due to limited staffing. This is causing refund delays. Taxpayers who have already filed a paper return should know that the IRS is processing paper returns in the order in which they are received.In addition, interest on individual 2019 refunds reflected on returns filed by July 15, 2020, will generally be paid from April 15, 2020, until the date of the refund. Interest payments may be received separately from the refund and are considered taxable income in the year received.                                                          Common myths about tax refunds include:                                                                             Getting a refund this year means there&rsquo;s no need to adjust withholding for 2020                                                                             To help avoid a possible surprise next year, taxpayers should look to make changes now. Adjusting tax withholding with an employer can help ensure that neither too much nor too little tax is withheld from an employee&rsquo;s paycheck.                                                                             Calling the IRS or a tax professional will provide a better refund date                                                                             Contacting the IRS or a tax professional will not expedite a refund. IRS assistors and tax professionals cannot move up a refund date nor do they have access to any &ldquo;special&rdquo; information that will provide a more accurate refund date.                                                                             Ordering a tax transcript is a secret way to get a refund date                                                                             Ordering a tax transcript will not help taxpayers find out when they will get their refund and it does not accelerate the issue date of a refund.                                                                             The Where&rsquo;s My Refund? tool is wrong because there&rsquo;s no deposit date yet                                                                             WhenWhere&rsquo;s My Refund?shows the tax return status is received it means that we have received the tax return and are processing it. Some returns may take longer to process than others and needs further review. This includes when a return:                                                                               Includes errors                                                            Is incomplete                                                            Is affected by identity theft or fraud                                                            Includes a Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation, which could take up to 14 weeks to process                                                                             Taxpayers will be contacted by mail if the IRS needs more information to process a tax return. People waiting for a refund in the mail should plan for the additional time a check takes to arrive.                                                                             Something is wrong when the refund amount is less than expected                                                                             There are a lot of reasons that cause a tax refund to be different than expected. Situations that could decrease a refund include:                                                                               Taxpayer math errors or mistakes                                                            Owing federal or state taxes, child support, student loans or other federal non-tax obligations                                                            A portion of the refund is held while IRS reviews an item claimed on the return</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Many of us might encounter mutual funds in our daily life. But what exactly is mutual fund and what kind of function does it have?                                                                             Basically, a mutual fund is a type of financial vehicle made up of a pool of money collected from many investors to invest in securities like stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are operated by professional money managers, who allocate the fund&rsquo;s assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund&rsquo;s investors. Besides, a mutual fund&rsquo;s portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in its prospectus.                                                                             Many mutual funds give small or individual investors access to professionally managed portfolios of equities, bonds, and other securities. As a result, each shareholder participates proportionally in the gains or losses of the fund. Mutual funds invest in a vast number of securities, and its performance is usually tracked as the change in the total market cap of the fund, which is derived by the aggregating performance of the underlying investments.                                                                             That is, a mutual fund is both an investment and an actual company. For example, if you buy Apply stock, you are buying partial ownership of the company and its assets.                                                                             Similarly, when you invest in a mutual fund, you are actually buying partial ownership of the mutual fund company and its assets.                                                                             Investors typically earn a return from a mutual fund in three ways:                                                                                                                           Income is earned from dividends on stocks and interest on bonds held in the fund&rsquo;s portfolio. Funds usually give investors a choice either to receive a check for distributions or to reinvest the earnings and get more shares.                                                                                        When the fund sells securities which could have increased in price, the fund has a capital gain. Most funds also pass on these gains to investors in a distribution.                                                                                        If fund holdings increasing price but are not sold by the fund manager, the shares of this fund will increase in price as well. When you sell your mutual fund shares, you can earn a profit in the market.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Currently, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internet Revenue Service launched an online help portal to help non-filers receive economic impact payments. This online portal is also called &ldquo;IRS Help Online,&rdquo; where Americans who did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019 can submit basic personal information to the IRS so that they can receive payments in an easy way.                                                                             The full name of this online tool is &ldquo;Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here,&rdquo; which is designed for Americans who are not required to file tax returns to make sure they receive their payment as quickly and safely as possible. Inside this online portal, individuals could enter their bank account information, and thus their payment will be directly deposited in their bank account once IRS has proceeded tax return files.                                                                             How to find this online page? Well, you need to go to IRS.gov and click on the &ldquo;Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here&rdquo; button. After that, the tool will request basic information to confirm eligivility, calculate and send the Economic Impact Payments for you.                                                                             Economic Impact Payments might include basic information such as:                                                                                                                             Your full names and Social Security numbers, including for spouse and dependents                                                                                          Your mailing address                                                                                          Your bank account type, account and routing numbers.                                                                                                   Besides &ldquo;Non-Filers&rdquo; tool, the IRS also launches a separate online tool for tax return application, which is called &ldquo;Get My Payment.&rdquo; This tool allows taxpayers who filed their tax return in 2018 or 2019 but did not provide their bank information on their return to submit direct information so that they can receive payments immediately. &ldquo;Get My Payment&rdquo; will also allow taxpayers to track the status of their payment.                                                                             However, for Social Security recipients, if you did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019, you do not need to use these tools or take any actions. IRS will use the information on the Form SSA-1099 and Form RRB-1099 to generate $1,200 Economic Impact Payments.</div>

The official name for Social Security is &ldquo;the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program in the United States.&rdquo; It refers to a comprehensive federal benefits program designed to provide partial replacement income for older workers and their spouse, those whose spouse or qualifying ex-spouse have died, and the disabled. In some specific circumstances, it also supports children and beneficiaries.                                                                             The history of Social Security benefits could be traced back to 1935, when President Franklin Roosevelt signed the original Social Security Act into law. After a number of amendments, the current law includes several social insurance and social welfare programs, such as the issuance of Social Security benefits. All of these benefits are determined by a specific set of criteria issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA).                                                                             Social Security benefits work with the payroll taxes. Payroll taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax or the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA) (a tax designed for self-employed individuals) fund Social Security and all of its benefits. The Internal Revenue Service collects tax deposits and formally entrusts them to the Social Security Trust Fund, which is made up of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund. In other words, Social Security benefits are funded by the taxes.                                                                             Individuals qualify for Social Security old age (or retirement) benefits by paying into the program during their working years.                                                                             For example, full insurance is based on accumulating 40 credits from covered wages, and a worker can earn up to four credits a year. Starting in 2020, one credit is awarded for every $1,410 in earnings. Besides, this amount is adjusted annually to keep up with inflation, which means one credit might be worth more in the future years during an inflation.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Although many of us have certain understandings towards Disability benefits, we might wonder when and how to apply for Social Security benefits. This article intends to introduce the common procedures for this application.                                                                             If you become disabled, you should apply for Social Security benefits as soon as possible. You can apply for both Social Security and Supplemental Security Income:                                                                                                                             Social Security                                                                                                   This is a disability benefits, and it will not begin until the sixth full month of disability. The Social Security disability waiting period begins with the first full month after the date that IRS decides your disability began.                                                                                                                             Supplemental Security Income (SSI)                                                                                                   The IRS usually pays SSI disability benefits for the first full month after the date you filed your claim. If you file your document in a later date, the IRS will put the first month at the date you become eligible for SSI.

 <div class="postDescription">ach year, people might receive lots of IRS tax notices. Some might receive the letters, and some might receive the emails. Usually, the IRS sends millions of notices and letters to taxpayers for a variety of reasons, so we don&rsquo;t need to be panic when we receive the IRS tax notice. Here is something that we need to know when you receive an IRS tax notice.                                                                             When you receive an IRS tax notice, don&rsquo;t panic, since you often need to respond to take care of a notice.                                                                             IRS might send you a notice for many reasons. For example, IRS might concern about a specific issue on your federal tax return or tax account. A notice might tell you about changes to your account or ask you for more information. But sometimes it could also tell you have unpaid tax or you owe some moneys to the IRS. Different notices have different instructions about what you need to do. And what you need to do is to follow the instructions.                                                                             You may also get a notice that states the IRS has made a change or correction to your tax return. If you do refile your tax return, you then need to review the information and compare it with your original return to make sure that your return is correct and successful. If you agree with the amount of money on that notice, you usually do not need to reply with the correction letter, unless it gives you other instructions or you need to make a payment. If you do not agree with the notice, you have to response this letter. In this situation, you should write a letter to explain why you disagree with this amount, and you have to include any information and documents you want the IRS to consider. Besides, you have to mail your reply with the bottom tear-off portion of the notice, sending it to the address appeared in the upper left-hand corner of the notice. Remember, the IRS usually takes at least 30 days for a response.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Even we have to pay tax to the IRS, we still have several rights. Here are the lists for the bill of Rights for taxpayer according to the IRS:                                                                               The Right to Be Informed                                                                             We taxpayers have the right to know what we need to do comply with the tax laws. We could receive the clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. We also have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about our tax accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes.                                                                               The Right to Quality Service                                                                             When we meet difficulties, we have the right to receive prompt, courteous, and professional assistance in our dealings with the IRS. These instructions need to be in a way that we can easily understand, or we have the right to ask the IRS for further explanations. If we still cannot understand the instructions, the IRS needs to provide a supervisor about the inadequate service.                                                                               The Right to Pay No More than the Correct Amount of Tax                                                                             We must know that we have the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due, including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly. If we find out we pay more than the correct amount, we could file a letter to the IRS and explain our situation.                                                                               The Right to Privacy                                                                             Although the IRS knows lots of our personal information including SSN and our correct address, we still have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply with law and be no more intrusive than necessary. All the actions from the IRS will respect all due process rights, including search and seizure protection and the IRS will provide a collection due process hearing where applicable.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Many of us might have heard of property tax, which is a kind of tax paid on property owned by an individual or other legal entity. But we might don&rsquo;t know what exactly the property tax is and how the IRS calculate the property tax. This article intends to introduce the property tax in the United States.                                                                             Generally, property tax is a tax that is charged on your property, such as a corporation and a house. The most common type of property tax is a real estate ad-valorem tax, which is a kind of regressive tax (a tax imposed in such a manner that the tax rate decreases as the amount subject to taxation increases). In other words, if you own more real estate, the tax that charges on your will be less. The property is calculated by a local government where the property is located and paid by you, or the owner of the property. The tax is usually based on the value of the owned property, including lands and houses. But lots of jurisdictions also tax tangible personal property as property tax, such as vehicles (cars), boats, and helicopters.                                                                              The property tax will become a source for local infrastructures. For example, the local governing body will use the assessed taxes to fund water and sewer improvements, and provide law enforcement, fire protection, education, road and highway construction, libraries, and other services that benefit the community.                                                                              In the United States, because every state has its own laws and jurisdiction system, the property tax rates and the types of properties taxed also vary by states. Therefore, when we are purchasing a property, it&rsquo;s also essential to scrutinize the applicable tax laws. For instance, if you plan to buy a house in New Jersey while you are working in the city of New York, you might pay the property tax according to the law of Jersey state while you need to pay the income tax according to the regulation of New York City.</div>

However, if you choose to use TurboTax, you can&rsquo;t import income data or last year&rsquo;s tax info like H&amp;R Block would do.                                                                             TaxAct Free Edition                                                                             TaxAct Free Edition offers simple tax return and free filing for school tax deduction, W-2 processing and more. If you are self-employed, you can also use this software. There is an online answer center for questions and help with using TaxAct. However, like TurboTax, you can&rsquo;t import data.                                                                             TaxSlayer Simply Free                                                                             The paid version of TaxSlayer is the cheapest one among all tax software, which only needs $17. The free version is also good to use. It has good user interface and it&rsquo;s easy to use if you want to file a simple return. However, the deduction is useless if you only file a 1040 EZ.                                                                             FreeTaxUSA Free Edition                                                                             The FreeTaxUSA Free Edition allows you to file most forms of your taxed. You can import your data not only from last year, but also years prior to the next year, which makes things easier and help you file quickly.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">With the July 15 tax deadline now past, the Internal Revenue Service reminds all taxpayers that there is no secret way to find out when a refund will be issued.                                                                             Some key facts can help people understand the refund process better:                                                                               Taxpayers who file electronically and use direct deposit can expect their refund faster than those who mail a paper return, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak has reduced IRS staffing available to process paper returns.                                                            Taxpayers who file a paper tax return are likely to face processing and refund delays.                                                            The best and easiest way to check on a refund is Where&rsquo;s My Refund?                                                            The Where&rsquo;s My Refund? tool available on IRS.gov and the IRS2Go mobile app.                                                            A tax refund&rsquo;s status can be checked within 24 hours after the taxpayer receives the e-file acceptance notification.                                                            &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s My Refund?&rdquo; is updated once a day, usually overnight.                                                                             Processing delays for paper tax returns                                                                             The IRS is experiencing delays in processing paper tax returns due to limited staffing. This is causing refund delays. Taxpayers who have already filed a paper return should know that the IRS is processing paper returns in the order in which they are received.In addition, interest on individual 2019 refunds reflected on returns filed by July 15, 2020, will generally be paid from April 15, 2020, until the date of the refund. Interest payments may be received separately from the refund and are considered taxable income in the year received.                                                          Common myths about tax refunds include:                                                                             Getting a refund this year means there&rsquo;s no need to adjust withholding for 2020                                                                             To help avoid a possible surprise next year, taxpayers should look to make changes now. Adjusting tax withholding with an employer can help ensure that neither too much nor too little tax is withheld from an employee&rsquo;s paycheck.                                                                             Calling the IRS or a tax professional will provide a better refund date                                                                             Contacting the IRS or a tax professional will not expedite a refund. IRS assistors and tax professionals cannot move up a refund date nor do they have access to any &ldquo;special&rdquo; information that will provide a more accurate refund date.                                                                             Ordering a tax transcript is a secret way to get a refund date                                                                             Ordering a tax transcript will not help taxpayers find out when they will get their refund and it does not accelerate the issue date of a refund.                                                                             The Where&rsquo;s My Refund? tool is wrong because there&rsquo;s no deposit date yet                                                                             WhenWhere&rsquo;s My Refund?shows the tax return status is received it means that we have received the tax return and are processing it. Some returns may take longer to process than others and needs further review. This includes when a return:                                                                               Includes errors                                                            Is incomplete                                                            Is affected by identity theft or fraud                                                            Includes a Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation, which could take up to 14 weeks to process                                                                             Taxpayers will be contacted by mail if the IRS needs more information to process a tax return. People waiting for a refund in the mail should plan for the additional time a check takes to arrive.                                                                             Something is wrong when the refund amount is less than expected                                                                             There are a lot of reasons that cause a tax refund to be different than expected. Situations that could decrease a refund include:                                                                               Taxpayer math errors or mistakes                                                            Owing federal or state taxes, child support, student loans or other federal non-tax obligations                                                            A portion of the refund is held while IRS reviews an item claimed on the return</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Many of us might encounter mutual funds in our daily life. But what exactly is mutual fund and what kind of function does it have?                                                                             Basically, a mutual fund is a type of financial vehicle made up of a pool of money collected from many investors to invest in securities like stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are operated by professional money managers, who allocate the fund&rsquo;s assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund&rsquo;s investors. Besides, a mutual fund&rsquo;s portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in its prospectus.                                                                             Many mutual funds give small or individual investors access to professionally managed portfolios of equities, bonds, and other securities. As a result, each shareholder participates proportionally in the gains or losses of the fund. Mutual funds invest in a vast number of securities, and its performance is usually tracked as the change in the total market cap of the fund, which is derived by the aggregating performance of the underlying investments.                                                                             That is, a mutual fund is both an investment and an actual company. For example, if you buy Apply stock, you are buying partial ownership of the company and its assets.                                                                             Similarly, when you invest in a mutual fund, you are actually buying partial ownership of the mutual fund company and its assets.                                                                             Investors typically earn a return from a mutual fund in three ways:                                                                                                                           Income is earned from dividends on stocks and interest on bonds held in the fund&rsquo;s portfolio. Funds usually give investors a choice either to receive a check for distributions or to reinvest the earnings and get more shares.                                                                                        When the fund sells securities which could have increased in price, the fund has a capital gain. Most funds also pass on these gains to investors in a distribution.                                                                                        If fund holdings increasing price but are not sold by the fund manager, the shares of this fund will increase in price as well. When you sell your mutual fund shares, you can earn a profit in the market.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Currently, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internet Revenue Service launched an online help portal to help non-filers receive economic impact payments. This online portal is also called &ldquo;IRS Help Online,&rdquo; where Americans who did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019 can submit basic personal information to the IRS so that they can receive payments in an easy way.                                                                             The full name of this online tool is &ldquo;Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here,&rdquo; which is designed for Americans who are not required to file tax returns to make sure they receive their payment as quickly and safely as possible. Inside this online portal, individuals could enter their bank account information, and thus their payment will be directly deposited in their bank account once IRS has proceeded tax return files.                                                                             How to find this online page? Well, you need to go to IRS.gov and click on the &ldquo;Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here&rdquo; button. After that, the tool will request basic information to confirm eligivility, calculate and send the Economic Impact Payments for you.                                                                             Economic Impact Payments might include basic information such as:                                                                                                                             Your full names and Social Security numbers, including for spouse and dependents                                                                                          Your mailing address                                                                                          Your bank account type, account and routing numbers.                                                                                                   Besides &ldquo;Non-Filers&rdquo; tool, the IRS also launches a separate online tool for tax return application, which is called &ldquo;Get My Payment.&rdquo; This tool allows taxpayers who filed their tax return in 2018 or 2019 but did not provide their bank information on their return to submit direct information so that they can receive payments immediately. &ldquo;Get My Payment&rdquo; will also allow taxpayers to track the status of their payment.                                                                             However, for Social Security recipients, if you did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019, you do not need to use these tools or take any actions. IRS will use the information on the Form SSA-1099 and Form RRB-1099 to generate $1,200 Economic Impact Payments.</div>

The official name for Social Security is &ldquo;the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program in the United States.&rdquo; It refers to a comprehensive federal benefits program designed to provide partial replacement income for older workers and their spouse, those whose spouse or qualifying ex-spouse have died, and the disabled. In some specific circumstances, it also supports children and beneficiaries.                                                                             The history of Social Security benefits could be traced back to 1935, when President Franklin Roosevelt signed the original Social Security Act into law. After a number of amendments, the current law includes several social insurance and social welfare programs, such as the issuance of Social Security benefits. All of these benefits are determined by a specific set of criteria issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA).                                                                             Social Security benefits work with the payroll taxes. Payroll taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax or the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA) (a tax designed for self-employed individuals) fund Social Security and all of its benefits. The Internal Revenue Service collects tax deposits and formally entrusts them to the Social Security Trust Fund, which is made up of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund. In other words, Social Security benefits are funded by the taxes.                                                                             Individuals qualify for Social Security old age (or retirement) benefits by paying into the program during their working years.                                                                             For example, full insurance is based on accumulating 40 credits from covered wages, and a worker can earn up to four credits a year. Starting in 2020, one credit is awarded for every $1,410 in earnings. Besides, this amount is adjusted annually to keep up with inflation, which means one credit might be worth more in the future years during an inflation.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Although many of us have certain understandings towards Disability benefits, we might wonder when and how to apply for Social Security benefits. This article intends to introduce the common procedures for this application.                                                                             If you become disabled, you should apply for Social Security benefits as soon as possible. You can apply for both Social Security and Supplemental Security Income:                                                                                                                             Social Security                                                                                                   This is a disability benefits, and it will not begin until the sixth full month of disability. The Social Security disability waiting period begins with the first full month after the date that IRS decides your disability began.                                                                                                                             Supplemental Security Income (SSI)                                                                                                   The IRS usually pays SSI disability benefits for the first full month after the date you filed your claim. If you file your document in a later date, the IRS will put the first month at the date you become eligible for SSI.

 <div class="postDescription">ach year, people might receive lots of IRS tax notices. Some might receive the letters, and some might receive the emails. Usually, the IRS sends millions of notices and letters to taxpayers for a variety of reasons, so we don&rsquo;t need to be panic when we receive the IRS tax notice. Here is something that we need to know when you receive an IRS tax notice.                                                                             When you receive an IRS tax notice, don&rsquo;t panic, since you often need to respond to take care of a notice.                                                                             IRS might send you a notice for many reasons. For example, IRS might concern about a specific issue on your federal tax return or tax account. A notice might tell you about changes to your account or ask you for more information. But sometimes it could also tell you have unpaid tax or you owe some moneys to the IRS. Different notices have different instructions about what you need to do. And what you need to do is to follow the instructions.                                                                             You may also get a notice that states the IRS has made a change or correction to your tax return. If you do refile your tax return, you then need to review the information and compare it with your original return to make sure that your return is correct and successful. If you agree with the amount of money on that notice, you usually do not need to reply with the correction letter, unless it gives you other instructions or you need to make a payment. If you do not agree with the notice, you have to response this letter. In this situation, you should write a letter to explain why you disagree with this amount, and you have to include any information and documents you want the IRS to consider. Besides, you have to mail your reply with the bottom tear-off portion of the notice, sending it to the address appeared in the upper left-hand corner of the notice. Remember, the IRS usually takes at least 30 days for a response.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Even we have to pay tax to the IRS, we still have several rights. Here are the lists for the bill of Rights for taxpayer according to the IRS:                                                                               The Right to Be Informed                                                                             We taxpayers have the right to know what we need to do comply with the tax laws. We could receive the clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. We also have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about our tax accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes.                                                                               The Right to Quality Service                                                                             When we meet difficulties, we have the right to receive prompt, courteous, and professional assistance in our dealings with the IRS. These instructions need to be in a way that we can easily understand, or we have the right to ask the IRS for further explanations. If we still cannot understand the instructions, the IRS needs to provide a supervisor about the inadequate service.                                                                               The Right to Pay No More than the Correct Amount of Tax                                                                             We must know that we have the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due, including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly. If we find out we pay more than the correct amount, we could file a letter to the IRS and explain our situation.                                                                               The Right to Privacy                                                                             Although the IRS knows lots of our personal information including SSN and our correct address, we still have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply with law and be no more intrusive than necessary. All the actions from the IRS will respect all due process rights, including search and seizure protection and the IRS will provide a collection due process hearing where applicable.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Many of us might have heard of property tax, which is a kind of tax paid on property owned by an individual or other legal entity. But we might don&rsquo;t know what exactly the property tax is and how the IRS calculate the property tax. This article intends to introduce the property tax in the United States.                                                                             Generally, property tax is a tax that is charged on your property, such as a corporation and a house. The most common type of property tax is a real estate ad-valorem tax, which is a kind of regressive tax (a tax imposed in such a manner that the tax rate decreases as the amount subject to taxation increases). In other words, if you own more real estate, the tax that charges on your will be less. The property is calculated by a local government where the property is located and paid by you, or the owner of the property. The tax is usually based on the value of the owned property, including lands and houses. But lots of jurisdictions also tax tangible personal property as property tax, such as vehicles (cars), boats, and helicopters.                                                                              The property tax will become a source for local infrastructures. For example, the local governing body will use the assessed taxes to fund water and sewer improvements, and provide law enforcement, fire protection, education, road and highway construction, libraries, and other services that benefit the community.                                                                              In the United States, because every state has its own laws and jurisdiction system, the property tax rates and the types of properties taxed also vary by states. Therefore, when we are purchasing a property, it&rsquo;s also essential to scrutinize the applicable tax laws. For instance, if you plan to buy a house in New Jersey while you are working in the city of New York, you might pay the property tax according to the law of Jersey state while you need to pay the income tax according to the regulation of New York City.</div>

However, if you choose to use TurboTax, you can&rsquo;t import income data or last year&rsquo;s tax info like H&amp;R Block would do.                                                                             TaxAct Free Edition                                                                             TaxAct Free Edition offers simple tax return and free filing for school tax deduction, W-2 processing and more. If you are self-employed, you can also use this software. There is an online answer center for questions and help with using TaxAct. However, like TurboTax, you can&rsquo;t import data.                                                                             TaxSlayer Simply Free                                                                             The paid version of TaxSlayer is the cheapest one among all tax software, which only needs $17. The free version is also good to use. It has good user interface and it&rsquo;s easy to use if you want to file a simple return. However, the deduction is useless if you only file a 1040 EZ.                                                                             FreeTaxUSA Free Edition                                                                             The FreeTaxUSA Free Edition allows you to file most forms of your taxed. You can import your data not only from last year, but also years prior to the next year, which makes things easier and help you file quickly.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">With the July 15 tax deadline now past, the Internal Revenue Service reminds all taxpayers that there is no secret way to find out when a refund will be issued.                                                                             Some key facts can help people understand the refund process better:                                                                               Taxpayers who file electronically and use direct deposit can expect their refund faster than those who mail a paper return, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak has reduced IRS staffing available to process paper returns.                                                            Taxpayers who file a paper tax return are likely to face processing and refund delays.                                                            The best and easiest way to check on a refund is Where&rsquo;s My Refund?                                                            The Where&rsquo;s My Refund? tool available on IRS.gov and the IRS2Go mobile app.                                                            A tax refund&rsquo;s status can be checked within 24 hours after the taxpayer receives the e-file acceptance notification.                                                            &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s My Refund?&rdquo; is updated once a day, usually overnight.                                                                             Processing delays for paper tax returns                                                                             The IRS is experiencing delays in processing paper tax returns due to limited staffing. This is causing refund delays. Taxpayers who have already filed a paper return should know that the IRS is processing paper returns in the order in which they are received.In addition, interest on individual 2019 refunds reflected on returns filed by July 15, 2020, will generally be paid from April 15, 2020, until the date of the refund. Interest payments may be received separately from the refund and are considered taxable income in the year received.                                                          Common myths about tax refunds include:                                                                             Getting a refund this year means there&rsquo;s no need to adjust withholding for 2020                                                                             To help avoid a possible surprise next year, taxpayers should look to make changes now. Adjusting tax withholding with an employer can help ensure that neither too much nor too little tax is withheld from an employee&rsquo;s paycheck.                                                                             Calling the IRS or a tax professional will provide a better refund date                                                                             Contacting the IRS or a tax professional will not expedite a refund. IRS assistors and tax professionals cannot move up a refund date nor do they have access to any &ldquo;special&rdquo; information that will provide a more accurate refund date.                                                                             Ordering a tax transcript is a secret way to get a refund date                                                                             Ordering a tax transcript will not help taxpayers find out when they will get their refund and it does not accelerate the issue date of a refund.                                                                             The Where&rsquo;s My Refund? tool is wrong because there&rsquo;s no deposit date yet                                                                             WhenWhere&rsquo;s My Refund?shows the tax return status is received it means that we have received the tax return and are processing it. Some returns may take longer to process than others and needs further review. This includes when a return:                                                                               Includes errors                                                            Is incomplete                                                            Is affected by identity theft or fraud                                                            Includes a Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation, which could take up to 14 weeks to process                                                                             Taxpayers will be contacted by mail if the IRS needs more information to process a tax return. People waiting for a refund in the mail should plan for the additional time a check takes to arrive.                                                                             Something is wrong when the refund amount is less than expected                                                                             There are a lot of reasons that cause a tax refund to be different than expected. Situations that could decrease a refund include:                                                                               Taxpayer math errors or mistakes                                                            Owing federal or state taxes, child support, student loans or other federal non-tax obligations                                                            A portion of the refund is held while IRS reviews an item claimed on the return</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Many of us might encounter mutual funds in our daily life. But what exactly is mutual fund and what kind of function does it have?                                                                             Basically, a mutual fund is a type of financial vehicle made up of a pool of money collected from many investors to invest in securities like stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are operated by professional money managers, who allocate the fund&rsquo;s assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund&rsquo;s investors. Besides, a mutual fund&rsquo;s portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in its prospectus.                                                                             Many mutual funds give small or individual investors access to professionally managed portfolios of equities, bonds, and other securities. As a result, each shareholder participates proportionally in the gains or losses of the fund. Mutual funds invest in a vast number of securities, and its performance is usually tracked as the change in the total market cap of the fund, which is derived by the aggregating performance of the underlying investments.                                                                             That is, a mutual fund is both an investment and an actual company. For example, if you buy Apply stock, you are buying partial ownership of the company and its assets.                                                                             Similarly, when you invest in a mutual fund, you are actually buying partial ownership of the mutual fund company and its assets.                                                                             Investors typically earn a return from a mutual fund in three ways:                                                                                                                           Income is earned from dividends on stocks and interest on bonds held in the fund&rsquo;s portfolio. Funds usually give investors a choice either to receive a check for distributions or to reinvest the earnings and get more shares.                                                                                        When the fund sells securities which could have increased in price, the fund has a capital gain. Most funds also pass on these gains to investors in a distribution.                                                                                        If fund holdings increasing price but are not sold by the fund manager, the shares of this fund will increase in price as well. When you sell your mutual fund shares, you can earn a profit in the market.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Currently, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internet Revenue Service launched an online help portal to help non-filers receive economic impact payments. This online portal is also called &ldquo;IRS Help Online,&rdquo; where Americans who did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019 can submit basic personal information to the IRS so that they can receive payments in an easy way.                                                                             The full name of this online tool is &ldquo;Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here,&rdquo; which is designed for Americans who are not required to file tax returns to make sure they receive their payment as quickly and safely as possible. Inside this online portal, individuals could enter their bank account information, and thus their payment will be directly deposited in their bank account once IRS has proceeded tax return files.                                                                             How to find this online page? Well, you need to go to IRS.gov and click on the &ldquo;Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here&rdquo; button. After that, the tool will request basic information to confirm eligivility, calculate and send the Economic Impact Payments for you.                                                                             Economic Impact Payments might include basic information such as:                                                                                                                             Your full names and Social Security numbers, including for spouse and dependents                                                                                          Your mailing address                                                                                          Your bank account type, account and routing numbers.                                                                                                   Besides &ldquo;Non-Filers&rdquo; tool, the IRS also launches a separate online tool for tax return application, which is called &ldquo;Get My Payment.&rdquo; This tool allows taxpayers who filed their tax return in 2018 or 2019 but did not provide their bank information on their return to submit direct information so that they can receive payments immediately. &ldquo;Get My Payment&rdquo; will also allow taxpayers to track the status of their payment.                                                                             However, for Social Security recipients, if you did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019, you do not need to use these tools or take any actions. IRS will use the information on the Form SSA-1099 and Form RRB-1099 to generate $1,200 Economic Impact Payments.</div>

The official name for Social Security is &ldquo;the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program in the United States.&rdquo; It refers to a comprehensive federal benefits program designed to provide partial replacement income for older workers and their spouse, those whose spouse or qualifying ex-spouse have died, and the disabled. In some specific circumstances, it also supports children and beneficiaries.                                                                             The history of Social Security benefits could be traced back to 1935, when President Franklin Roosevelt signed the original Social Security Act into law. After a number of amendments, the current law includes several social insurance and social welfare programs, such as the issuance of Social Security benefits. All of these benefits are determined by a specific set of criteria issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA).                                                                             Social Security benefits work with the payroll taxes. Payroll taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax or the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA) (a tax designed for self-employed individuals) fund Social Security and all of its benefits. The Internal Revenue Service collects tax deposits and formally entrusts them to the Social Security Trust Fund, which is made up of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund. In other words, Social Security benefits are funded by the taxes.                                                                             Individuals qualify for Social Security old age (or retirement) benefits by paying into the program during their working years.                                                                             For example, full insurance is based on accumulating 40 credits from covered wages, and a worker can earn up to four credits a year. Starting in 2020, one credit is awarded for every $1,410 in earnings. Besides, this amount is adjusted annually to keep up with inflation, which means one credit might be worth more in the future years during an inflation.</div>

 <div class="postDescription">Although many of us have certain understandings towards Disability benefits, we might wonder when and how to apply for Social Security benefits. This article intends to introduce the common procedures for this application.                                                                             If you become disabled, you should apply for Social Security benefits as soon as possible. You can apply for both Social Security and Supplemental Security Income:                                                                                                                             Social Security                                                                                                   This is a disability benefits, and it will not begin until the sixth full month of disability. The Social Security disability waiting period begins with the first full month after the date that IRS decides your disability began.                                                                                                                             Supplemental Security Income (SSI)                                                                                                   The IRS usually pays SSI disability benefits for the first full month after the date you filed your claim. If you file your document in a later date, the IRS will put the first month at the date you become eligible for SSI.                                                                             If you want to apply for Social Security benefits, you can apply for it online. If you prefer, you can apply by calling IRS&rsquo;s toll-free number, 1-800-772-1213. The representatives from IRS can make an appointment for your application to be taken over the telephone or at any convenient Social Security office.                                                                             For people who are suffering from deaf or hard of hearing, they could call the IRS&rsquo;s toll-free &ldquo;TYY&rdquo; number, which is 1-800-325-0778 between 8AM and 5:30PM on Monday through Friday, to receive special assistance.</div>
